  Labels (or tags) are used to group multiple agents into one logical group. For
  example, if you have multiple Windows agents and you have a job that must run
  on Windows, then you could configure all your Windows agents to have the label
  windows, and then tie that job to this label. This would ensure that your job
  runs on one of your Windows agents, but not on any agents without this label.

<p>
  Labels do not necessarily have to represent the operating system on the agent;
  you can also use labels to note the CPU architecture, or that a certain tool
  is installed on the agent.
</p>

<p>
  Labels may contain any non-space characters, but you should avoid special
  characters such as any of these: <code>!&|&lt;&gt;()</code>, as other Jenkins features allow for
  defining label expressions, where these characters may be used.

<p>
  Note that you can only provide a single label in this box.
